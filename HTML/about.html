                    <h1>Mikel Arteta</h1>
                    <p>In this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is Arteta and the second or maternal family
                        name
                        is
                        Amatriain.</p>
                    <p>Mikel Arteta Amatriain (born 26 March 1982) is a Spanish professional football manager and former
                        player.
                        He is the
                        manager of Premier League club Arsenal.
                    </p>
                    <p>Arteta began his senior career at Barcelona in 1999 but limited playing time led to a loan to
                        Paris
                        Saint-Germain in
                        2001. He then signed for Rangers, winning the Scottish Premier League and Scottish League Cup
                        double
                        in
                        his debut
                        season. After a brief return to hometown club Real Sociedad, Arteta joined Everton on loan in
                        2005;
                        he
                        later signed
                        permanently. He signed for Arsenal in 2011, where he won two FA Cups and served as captain from
                        2014
                        until his
                        retirement in 2016.
                    </p>
                    <p>Arteta represented Spain through several youth levels, but never played for the senior national
                        team.
                        After retiring,
                        he was appointed as an assistant coach to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. In 2019, he returned
                        to
                        Arsenal as head
                        coach and won the FA Cup in his first year; his title was changed to manager in September
                        2020
                        to
                        reflect his
                        broader remit at the club.</p>

                <h1>Playing Career</h1>
                <article>
                    <h2>Early Career</h2>
                    <p>Born in San Sebastián, Basque Country, Arteta began his football career at Antiguoko and
                        befriended fellow midfielder
                        Xabi Alonso as they played together every weekend. The two often played along the beaches and
                        gutters of San Sebastián
                        and dreamed of playing together at Real Sociedad.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h2>Club career</h2>
                    <p>Arteta left for the FC Barcelona B squad at 15 years of age while Alonso signed for Real Sociedad
                        later. Arteta
                        failed to break into the first team, and went out on loan to French club Paris Saint-Germain in
                        December 2000. During a
                        season and a half in Paris, Arteta was used by manager Luis Fernández primarily as a playmaker.
                        He made his first
                        appearances in the UEFA Champions League in the 2000–01 second group stage. PSG wanted to keep
                        Arteta at the end of the
                        loan period, and did have a 'buy first' option. Instead, Arteta was signed by Rangers in March
                        2002, after the Scottish
                        club made a financially stronger offer to Barcelona, leaving the French club after the end
                        of the 2001–02 season.

                <article>
                    <h2>Rangers</h2>
                    <p>Arteta signed for Scottish club Rangers in March 2002 in a £6 million transfer deal. He
                        enjoyed a successful first
                        season in Glasgow and quickly established himself as a first-team regular. Highlights were
                        scoring on his Old Firm
                        debut, and converting a late penalty on the final day of the 2002–03 season, which proved
                        vital for goal
                        difference as Rangers completed the domestic treble of the Scottish Premier League title,
                        Scottish Cup and Scottish
                        League Cup (Arteta was injured shortly before the 2003 Scottish Cup Final and missed the
                        match).
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        Arteta started his second season with Rangers by scoring six goals in the first six games of the
                        season as the club
                        qualified for the Champions League group stages, although they did not qualify from that group
                        and ended the campaign
                        without a trophy. Arteta returned to Spain after two seasons in Glasgow; he later credited his
                        spell at Rangers as
                        helping him develop as a player, stating "Scottish football was tough, really tough. It was
                        really physical, people got
                        at you and I had to improve on that a lot. I think I did that to get to the level that the
                        Premier League required of
                        me."

                    <h2>Real Sociedad</h2>
                    <p>He joined Real Sociedad for €5.2 million in 2004 with the idea being that Arteta and Xabi Alonso
                        could play together.
                        However, Alonso left for Liverpool and Arteta failed to establish himself in the team,
                        starting only three league
                        matches in the half-season he spent back in San Sebastián.

                <article>
                    <h2>Everton</h2>
                    <p>Everton manager David Moyes signed Arteta in the 2005 January transfer window on loan with a view
                        to a permanent
                        transfer. Seen as a replacement for Danish midfielder Thomas Gravesen who had moved to Real
                        Madrid, Arteta played a
                        vital part in helping Everton achieve the possibility of qualifying for the Champions League
                        when they finished fourth
                        in the Premier League; however, they were knocked out by Villarreal in the last qualifying
                        round. He scored his first
                        Everton goal in a 4–0 victory over Crystal Palace, and signed a permanent five-year deal in
                        July 2005 for a fee of
                        £2 million.
                    </p> <br>

                    <p>The 2005–06 season saw Arteta pick up both the Everton Fans' Player of the Season and the
                        Players' Player of the Season
                        awards. Arteta's good form extended into 2006–07. As well as retaining his starting place, he
                        frequently turned in
                        man-of-the-match displays, and finished the season with nine goals from the 35 league games he
                        played. Arteta was
                        awarded the Player of the Season Award for the second consecutive year. He was also voted the
                        Premier League's
                        'Midfielder of the Year' by the viewers of Sky Sports, beating PFA Players' Player of the Year
                        Cristiano Ronaldo.</p> <br>

                    <p>Arteta's creativity was an essential part of Everton's attacking play the following
                        season,[citation needed] and he had
                        scored six goals by the end of January. That improved further a season later, with Arteta
                        scoring nine times in the
                        2006–07 season and once again ending the season as the Player of the Year. He helped Everton
                        secure a place in the UEFA
                        Cup and was ranked by the ACTIM Index as the sixth best player in the Premier League, but it did
                        not earn him a call-up
                        into the full Spain squad. During the summer of 2007, he signed a new five-year
                        contract.</p> <br>

                    <p>
                        Arteta added another accolade to his growing collection during the 2007–08 season, when he
                        picked up the North West
                        Footballer of the Year award. He then became the first Everton player in five years to receive
                        the Liverpool Echo's
                        Sports Personality of the Year award in January 2008.[citation needed]
                    </p> <br>

                    <p>Arteta suffered a stomach injury in the second half of the season, and shortly before the final
                        game of the campaign, he
                        underwent surgery to rectify the problem. He scored his first goal of the 2008–09 season in
                        the Premier League
                        opener versus Blackburn Rovers with a free kick. He was named captain for a 2–2 draw with
                        Newcastle United, scoring a
                        penalty in the game. In February, Arteta was carried off on a stretcher in a 0–0 draw with
                        Newcastle having injured a
                        ligament in his knee, days after his first inclusion in the Spain national team squad. The
                        injury kept him out for the
                        rest of the 2008–09 season and the first five months of 2009–10. Over the course of the season,
                        Arteta began to play in
                        the centre of the field again, usually being partnered with a defensive midfielder. This gave
                        him the freedom to dictate
                        the tempo of the game and connect with Pienaar and Osman on the wing.[citation needed]
                    </p> <br>

                    <p>Arteta made his return from injury in January 2010 as a substitute in an FA Cup tie against
                        Birmingham City, before
                        starting in a 2–1 home Premier League win against Chelsea. His first two goals of the season
                        were scored in a 5–1 win
                        over Hull City in March 2010. In August that year, he signed a five-year contract extension with
                        Everton.</p> <br>

                    <p>The 2010–11 season proved to be not as successful as expected for both the team and the player.
                        After early goals in the
                        season, against Manchester United in a thriller 3–3 comeback at Goodison Park, and in a 2–0 win
                        in the Merseyside derby,
                        Arteta suffered a loss of form that would be crucial in Everton's push for a European spot. He
                        began to show again
                        glimpses of creative power in the final part of the season, when he was played again on the
                        wing, enjoying more freedom
                        and space.[citation needed]</p> <br>

                    <p>Upon departing Everton, Arteta said "I am 29 years old so I haven't got much time left to take a
                        chance like this one. I
                        have done my best for Everton." A few weeks later, he stated that the spirit in Everton's
                        dressing room is the 'best
                        in football'.</p>

                    <h2>Arsenal</h2>
                    <p>Arteta signed with Arsenal on 31 August 2011 on a four-year deal for a reported fee of £10
                        million. He made his
                        debut on 10 September in a 1–0 home win against Swansea City, and scored his first Premier
                        League goal for Arsenal
                        in a 4–3 loss against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. Arteta got his first chance to captain
                        the Gunners in the
                        third-round FA Cup victory over Leeds United, a game in that marked the second Arsenal debut of
                        Thierry Henry. Arteta
                        suffered an ankle sprain in his side's 2–1 loss to Wigan Athletic on 16 April, which sidelined
                        him for the remainder of
                        the season. Despite this he made 29 appearances all season, scoring 6 times, and was voted
                        by the fans as the fifth
                        most important player of the 2011–12 campaign in Arsenal's Player of the Season poll.
                    </p> <br>

                    <p>
                        Following the departure of captain Robin van Persie, Arteta was made Arsenal's vice-captain for
                        the 2012–13 season.
                        He was voted by the fans as the fourth best player of the 2012–13 campaign in Arsenal's Player
                        of the Season poll, after
                        leading the team to their 17th consecutive top four finish. He missed the beginning of 2013–14
                        due to injury, but
                        returned to the squad by the end of September, going on to score and be sent off in the same
                        match, a 2–0 win away
                        to Crystal Palace in October. Arsenal reached the 2014 FA Cup Final, with Arteta scoring
                        against former club Everton
                        in the quarter-final, as well as in the semi-final shootout against Wigan Athletic.
                        Arteta captained the side
                        for the final at Wembley, leading them to a 3–2 win against Hull City and receiving his first
                        major honour in English
                        football.

                        Arteta became Arsenal's new club captain ahead of the 2014–15 season. He won his first
                        trophy as full-time
                        captain, playing the full 90 minutes as Arsenal beat Manchester City 3–0 in the 2014 FA
                        Community Shield.
                        Despite his new appointment, he would only make 11 appearances for the whole season, scoring
                        once. Arteta signed a
                        one-year extension with Arsenal for the 2015–16 season and came on as a substitute as
                        Arsenal beat Chelsea 1–0 to
                        win the 2015 FA Community Shield, his first competitive appearance for the club since
                        November 2014. His final game
                        for Arsenal came on the last day of the season. Arteta came on as a substitute and forced Aston
                        Villa goalkeeper Mark
                        Bunn into scoring an own goal after his shot went off the crossbar. He received a standing
                        ovation from the crowd at
                        full time.

                    <h2>International career
                    </h2>
                    <p>Arteta played for Spain at youth level. He played in the victorious 1999 UEFA European Under-16
                        Championship
                        campaign, at the 1999 UEFA–CAF Meridian Cup, 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship, and
                        captained the side in the 2004
                        U21 European Championships qualifying campaign.[citation needed] In 2010, there were moves by
                        the English FA and Fabio
                        Capello to see if Arteta could represent England, believing he qualified under FIFA's five-year
                        residency rule. FIFA
                        ruled this out, however, with Arteta claiming in an interview in 2016 that he "almost went
                        to war with FIFA" over
                        the ruling.
                    </p> <br>

                    <p>Arteta was believed to be in Spain's squad in February 2009 but a cruciate knee ligament injury
                        meant his name was
                        removed from the list before the squad was announced.

                        Often noted to be one of the best players in modern times to be omitted a senior international
                        cap, Arteta played at a
                        time when Spain had several enormously high quality players available in his
                        position.</p>

                    <h2>Style of play
                    </h2>
                    <p>Arteta initially started out playing as a number 10 in the Barcelona youth system, and was later
                        shifted to the position
                        of a "pivot" or defensive midfielder, as he was thought to be a player in the mould of Pep
                        Guardiola. He was rated
                        as the sixth most effective player in the Premier League in 2006–07 by the official player
                        ratings system the Actim
                        Index. Arteta returned to his original deeper midfield role at Arsenal. in which he excelled
                        as his team's
                        playmaker, due to his technique, skill, vision, passing, awareness, and tactical
                        intelligence. His total
                        of 12 league assists in the 2006–07 season was third to Cesc Fàbregas and Cristiano Ronaldo.
                        With 100 fouls
                        committed against him in the same season, he was the most fouled player in the Premier
                        League.

                <h1>Coaching Career</h1>

                <article>
                    <h2>Manchester City
                    </h2>
                    <p>Arteta had three options upon retirement. He was offered to lead the Arsenal Academy, by Arsène
                        Wenger, join Mauricio
                        Pochettino's (his team-mate from PSG) backroom staff at Tottenham Hotspur or join Pep
                        Guardiola's coaching team at
                        Manchester City. On 3 July 2016, Arteta was appointed an assistant coach at Manchester City,[59]
                        alongside Brian Kidd
                        and Domènec Torrent, who operated as deputies to Pep Guardiola.
                    </p> <br>

                    <p>Guardiola and Arteta first met at the Barcelona academy, although Guardiola was already
                        established in the first team,
                        being 11 years older than Arteta. Since then the two kept in touch. Guardiola was convinced
                        Arteta – who was an Arsenal
                        player at the time – would make a good coach when he called him to get information on Chelsea,
                        prior to their 2012
                        Champions League semifinals against Barcelona.</p> <br>

                    <p>In 2015, when Guardiola was exiting Bayern Munich, Arteta, in his final year as a player,
                        re-connected and decided to
                        work together. Arteta stood in as Man City manager in a 2–1 Champions League loss against
                        Lyon on 19 September 2018,
                        because of Guardiola's touchline ban. At Man City, Arteta won two Premier League titles, an
                        FA Cup, and two EFL
                        Cups. In 2018, Arteta became strongly linked with the Arsenal manager's vacancy, following the
                        departure of his former
                        manager Arsène Wenger, but Unai Emery was eventually hired.</p>

                    <h2>Arsenal
                    </h2>
                    <h3>2019–21: Early years and FA Cup</h3>
                    <p>On 20 December 2019, Arteta was appointed head coach at former club Arsenal, signing a deal until
                        2023. Upon his
                        appointment, he stated that he believed the club had lost direction and that he didn't want
                        players to shirk
                        responsibility: "I want people to take responsibility for their jobs and I want people who
                        deliver passion and energy in
                        the football club. Anyone who doesn’t buy into this, or that has a negative effect or whatever,
                        is not good enough for
                        this environment or this culture.” <br>
                    </p>

                    <p>On 26 December 2019, Arteta took charge for the first time as an Arsenal manager for their
                        Premier League match against
                        Bournemouth which ended in a 1–1 draw, thanks to a second half equaliser from Pierre-Emerick
                        Aubameyang. Despite the
                        draw, he stated he was pleased with the "attitude, passion and the fighting spirit" of his
                        players. On 1 January
                        2020, Arteta won his first match as Arsenal coach after a 2–0 win over Manchester United at the
                        Emirates.</p> <br>

                    <p>On 18 July 2020, Arsenal beat Arteta's former employer Manchester City 2–0 in the FA Cup
                        semi-final, leading Arsenal to
                        their fourth FA Cup Final in seven years, and Arteta's first in charge. Arsenal went on to win
                        the final 2–1 over
                        Chelsea for a record 14th victory, making Arteta the first person to win the FA Cup as both
                        captain and coach of
                        Arsenal.Moreover, he became the first head coach or manager to win a major trophy in his
                        first season in charge of
                        the club since George Graham in 1986-87.</p> <br>

                    <p>On 29 August 2021, Arteta won his second trophy as manager after Arsenal beat Liverpool 5–4 on
                        penalties in the FA
                        Community Shield. On 10 September, Arteta's role was formally changed from first team head
                        coach to manager,
                        reflecting a wider remit at the club.</p> <br>

                    <p>On 23 January 2021, Arteta had his first defeat in the FA Cup in his managerial career as Arsenal
                        was knocked out by
                        Southampton in the fourth round, unable to defend the title. On 14 March 2021, Arteta
                        claimed his first victory in
                        the North London derby as a manager thanks to goals from Martin Ødegaard and Alexandre Lacazette
                        in a 2–1 win. That
                        was also Arsenal's first victory over Tottenham since December 2018. In the Europa League,
                        he led Arsenal to the
                        semi-finals, in which they lost 2–1 on aggregate to Unai Emery’s Villarreal. Later on,
                        Arsenal finished 8th in the
                        Premier League, and the 25-year run of participating in European competitions came to an
                        end.</p>
